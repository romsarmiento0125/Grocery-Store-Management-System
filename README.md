# Grocery Store Management System

This repository contains the **Grocery Store Management System**, a capstone project (thesis) developed during our time as students. The goal of this project was to create a comprehensive management system for grocery stores, streamlining operations such as inventory management, sales tracking, and reporting, with a vision to drive digital transformation for small to medium businesses.

## Project Details

- **Frontend Framework:** Vue.js (Vue 2)  
  > Note: Vue 2 is no longer supported. The system needs to be updated to Vue 3.
- **Backend Framework:** Laravel (PHP)
- **Status:** Not production-ready. Built for presentation and demonstration purposes only.

> **Notice:**  
> This project was developed using Vue 2 and Laravel. As Vue 2 is now outdated, the frontend requires an upgrade to Vue 3. The project contains known errors and was never used in production—only for academic presentation, where it was hosted in the cloud for demonstration.  
>  
> I am open to collaborations and contributions. If you are interested in reworking this project, please reach out! In the future, I plan to redo this system to address optimizations and improvements, aiming for a more robust and scalable solution.

## Features

- Inventory management
- Sales and transaction recording
- User authentication and roles
- Reporting and analytics
- And more...

## Important Notice

- The system contains known errors and was not used in a live production environment.
- Hosted in the cloud only for thesis/capstone presentation.
- Major updates and optimizations are needed—a complete rework is recommended for future use.
